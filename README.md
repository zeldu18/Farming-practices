# Current Farming Practices of Rice Farmers In VietNam

## Objectives
Analyze the profiles of farmers and rice production practices in the Mekong River Delta (MRD).
Quantify key production parameters (yield, fertilizer use efficiency, cost-benefit, greenhouse gas emissions) to identify gaps in sustainable, low-carbon rice production.
Examine farming practices, perspectives, and needs across different socioeconomic groups of rice farmers.

## Project Highlights
Developed an end-to-end Random Forest model in Python (scikit-learn) to predict soil properties from geospatial data (1.2M data points), streamlining a 4-year data collection process.
Built geospatial data pipelines to enhance fertilizer production by identifying key product features, driving business decisions.
Created data dashboards for 12 cities, assisting 10,000 farmers, and helping boost incomes by 20% through analysis of income gaps and farming practices using Python.
